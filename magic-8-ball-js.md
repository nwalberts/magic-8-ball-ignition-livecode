### Work that Magic

Complete the following using the included `responses` array in `main.js`.

Please provide your code below each of the corresponding comments for each drill. Your code should run even if this array of responses contained different strings.

- Confirm the correct number of responses have been stored by printing the number to the console (`20`)
- Ask the user what their question is, and store it as a variable called `question`
- Output a random response to the user's question
- Output the number of responses that include the word "yes"
- Output the number of responses that include the words "no" or "not"
- Output the alphabetized list of responses
- Output the first and last responses from the alphabetized list
- Delete two of the negative responses
- Reassign 'Ask again later' to the beginning of the array
- Add 1 response of your choosing to the current list
- Add 3 more responses all at once to the current list! You should be able to do this with one line of code. Tip: don't hesitate to check out the MDN JavaScript docs on Array.prototype.push() if need be.
- Confirm the correct number of responses have been removed and added by printing the number of responses to the console (`22`)

> Pro Tip: Use the following function to select a random index given the length of an array.

```no-highlight

let randomIndex = (length) => {
  return Math.floor((Math.random() * length));
}
```
