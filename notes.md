## Overview  

## Tips
- when stuck: evaluate what parts of the code you do know, break the problem into parts, scan some documentation, or keep moving and put a question in the channel, even if for later
- be vulnerable - share your code
- ask more questions. Our documentation isn't perfect, especially if you don't respond well to written study 
- anything you can do with advanced array methods you can do with forEach or for 

## Topics worthy of review
- accessing arrays
- looping with forEach and for()
- basic arrow function with args
- function scope 
- callbackFunction!!!!!
- map, find, filter, reduce
